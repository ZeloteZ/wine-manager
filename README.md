## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

While there is no need to manually (not with the GUI) configure anything, there still is the option to do so.
This may help in error situations.
The application stores its configuration in `~/.config/wine-manager/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "proton_dir": "~/.local/share/proton-builds",
  "default_proton": "",
  "prefix_proton_map": {},
  "extra_prefix_dirs": [
    "/custom/path/to/prefixes"
  ],
  "prefix_favorites": {
    "/home/user/.wine": [
      "/home/user/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/MyApp/app.exe"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options
- **proton_dir**: Directory where Proton-GE versions are installed
- **extra_prefix_dirs**: Additional directories to scan for prefixes
- **prefix_favorites**: Favorite applications for each prefix

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No prefixes found"**
- Ensure Wine is installed: `wine --version`
- Check if `~/.wine` exists or create a prefix: `winecfg`
- Add custom directories using "üìÅ Add Dir" button

**"Application won't launch"**
- Verify the executable path is correct
- Check Wine prefix integrity: `wine winecfg` in the prefix
- Ensure required dependencies are installed in the prefix
- **Check the logs**: Click "üìã Logs" to see detailed error messages

**"GUI looks wrong/broken"**
- Update PySide6: `pip install --upgrade PySide6`
- Try a different desktop environment
- Check if Qt6 themes are properly installed

### Debug Mode
Run with debug output:
```bash
python3 wine_manager.py 2>&1 | tee debug.log
```

### Reset Configuration
```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/wine-manager/
```
